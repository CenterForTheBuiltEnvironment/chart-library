This section introduces **Git** and **GitHub** for researchers who want to track changes, collaborate, and maintain reproducible workflows.

Version control is essential for any code-based research project. It allows you to:

- track every change to your files over time
- revert to previous versions when something breaks
- collaborate without overwriting each other's work
- maintain a clear history of how analysis evolved

---

## What is Git?

**Git** is a version control system that runs on your computer. It tracks changes to files in a project folder (called a repository). Every time you save a snapshot (called a commit), Git records what changed, when, and who made the change.

Git works locally—you don't need an internet connection to use it.

---

## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a web platform that hosts Git repositories online. It adds:

- cloud backup for your code
- collaboration features (pull requests, issues, code review)
- visibility for sharing work publicly or with collaborators

Other alternatives exist (GitLab, Bitbucket), but GitHub is the most common in research contexts.

**Key distinction:** Git is the tool. GitHub is a service that uses Git.

---

## Why use version control?

**1. No more "final_v2_REAL_final.R"**: Instead of duplicating files with confusing names, Git tracks the full history of each file. You can always go back to any previous version.


**2. Safe experimentation**: Create a branch to try something new. If it works, merge it in. If not, delete the branch. Your main code stays safe.


**3. Collaboration without chaos**: Multiple people can work on the same project. Git handles merging changes and flags conflicts when edits overlap.


**4. Reproducibility**: A Git history shows exactly how analysis evolved. Combined with good commit messages, it serves as a lab notebook for code.

## Git 101: Core concepts

### Repository (repo)

A folder tracked by Git. Contains your files plus a hidden `.git` folder that stores the version history.

### Commit

A snapshot of your project at a point in time. Each commit has:

- a unique ID (hash)
- a message describing the change
- a timestamp and author

### Branch

A parallel line of development. The default branch is usually called `main`. You can create branches to work on features without affecting `main`.

### Remote

A copy of your repository hosted elsewhere (e.g., on GitHub). You push commits to the remote and pull updates from it.

---

## Basic Git workflow

The typical daily workflow:

```bash
# 1. Check what's changed
git status

# 2. Stage files you want to commit
git add filename.R
git add .                # stages all changes

# 3. Commit with a message
git commit -m "Add thermal comfort analysis"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push
```

---

## Essential commands

### Setup and configuration

```bash
# Set your identity (once per machine)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

# Clone an existing repository
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Initialize a new repository
git init
```

### Daily use

```bash
# Check status of working directory
git status

# View commit history
git log
git log --oneline        # compact view

# Stage changes
git add <file>
git add .

# Commit staged changes
git commit -m "Descriptive message"

# Push commits to remote
git push

# Pull latest changes from remote
git pull
```

### Branching

```bash
# List branches
git branch

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature-name

# Switch to existing branch
git checkout main

# Merge branch into current branch
git merge feature-name
```

### Undoing things

```bash
# Discard changes in working directory
git checkout -- <file>

# Unstage a file (keep changes)
git reset HEAD <file>

# View what changed
git diff
git diff --staged        # staged changes only
```

---

## Writing good commit messages

Commit messages should explain **why**, not just what. Future you (and collaborators) will thank you.

**Good:**
```
Fix temperature unit conversion in comfort model

The original code assumed Fahrenheit input but data is in Celsius.
This caused PMV calculations to be wildly off.
```

**Less useful:**
```
Fixed bug
```

Keep the first line under 50 characters. Add detail in the body if needed.

---

## Recommended workflow for research

1. **One repo per project** — keep data, code, and outputs together
2. **Commit often** — small, logical chunks are easier to understand
3. **Use branches for experiments** — keep `main` stable
4. **Write meaningful messages** — your future self will read them
5. **Push regularly** — backup your work and enable collaboration

## Getting started

#### Option 1: GitHub Desktop

A graphical interface for Git. Good for beginners or those who prefer visual tools.

Download: [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)

#### Option 2: Command line

More powerful and portable. The commands above work on any system with Git installed. This is what we recommend.

Download Git: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

#### Option 3: IDE integration

RStudio, VS Code, and most editors have built-in Git support. Look for the "Git" or "Source Control" panel.
